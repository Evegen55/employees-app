To upload and deploy the application to the cloud service, you must include a manifest.json ile in the application archive.
The archive could be a .zip, .tgz, .tar, or .gz ile. In the manifest .json ile, you need to state the Java version to use
and the file to run to start the application. The manifest can contain some other coniguration values, but those are optional.
